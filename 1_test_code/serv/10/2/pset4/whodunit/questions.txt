1.  stdint.h is a header file containing typedefs and macros that allows making integer variables of custom sizes.
2.  To fill up space in a file precisely how you want to, which is helpful for avoiding "gaps" for example when storing the
    metadata of a file.
3.  Byte = 8 bits = 1 byte
    DWORD = 32 bits = 4 bytes
    LONG = 32 bits = 4 bytes
    WORD = 16 bits = 2 bytes
4.  Hex: 0x424d
    ASCII: BM
5.  biSize is the total size of the image in bytes (pixels + padding)
    bfSize is the size of the file in bytes (pixels + padding + headers)
6.  If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is top-down and its origin is the upper-left corner 
7.  biBitCount
8.  If copy.c can't find the file used as one of the arguments, it will return NULL.
9.  So that the file is read 1 byte at a time
10. 3. If biWidth is 3, then 3 pixels * 3 bytes each is 9 bytes. It must be padded to the nearest multiple of 4, which is 12 
    (12 - 9 = 3).
11. fseek moves to a particular location in a file. In copy.c the file pointer is offset by an amount "padding" in order to
    ignore it.
12. SEEK_CUR is an argument of the fseek function that determines that the offset (padding) is applied to the CURRENT file
    position, as opposed to the start or end of the file.
