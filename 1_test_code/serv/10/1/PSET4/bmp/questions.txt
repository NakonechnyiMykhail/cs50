0.  BMP  - 32bit format supports 4294967296 distinct colors.
    JPEG - 24bit format supports 16777216 distinct colors.
    PNG  - 24bit format supports 16777216 distinct colors.
    GIF  - 8bit format supports 256 distinct colors.

1.  GIF
2.  Lossless compression permits recovery of all the compressed bits, where lossy permanently eliminates some information.
3.  JPEG
4.  File's "header" gets filled with zeroes while the body remains untouched.
5.  Use special software to delete the said file which overwrites it with random patterns of 1 or 0. Or just incinerate the whole drive (fun!).
6.  It's a header file that provides a set of typedefs for integers specifying exact width in bits. Also defines min and max allowable values for each type.
7.  To ensure consistency between different platforms. E.g int can be 16 bit and 32 bit on some platforms.
8.  BYTE = 1 byte, DWORD = 4 bytes, LONG = 4 bytes, WORD = 2 bytes, 
9.  BM or 424D
10. bfsize indicates the size of the bitmap file including all the headers, 
    where bisize indicates the size of BITMAPINFOHEADER structure.
11. It means that the image is saved as top-down with origin point in upper-left.
12. biBitCount
13. It might return NULL if a file can't be createad, either because of lack of space or inability to access the file that already exists.
14. Because third argument in fread indicates the number of elements of a previously indicated size to be read. And in your code a struct needs to be read only once.
15. 3
16. It sets a stream position by an indicated offset either from beginning, end or current position of a file pointer.
17. It is the current position of a pointer inside a file.
